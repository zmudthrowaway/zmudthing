            This is a web client for playing muds.  If you don't know what a mud is, you probably don't want to.
            <br> 
            If you do, this is a (barebones) client to make it (slightly) easier to play.  Without something like this 
            you'd need to use telnet or some other  MUD client.  It works by forming a websocket connection to a 
            server (the owner of which, again, can see everything you type if you use this) which telnets to the mud. 
            <br>
            It has some basic mud-client functionality, but it is not as featureful as you would like, and 
            I don't plan on making it so.  You should save the html/js/css somewhere and tinker with it 
            yourself to add whatever functionality you need.  I only threw this together in a day or two because 
            someone else said I couldn't, I will not maintain this!
            <br><br>
            Here are some details on what little functionality I have added. Please note these are saved in your 
            browser (kind of like cookies). 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Commands: </b> Type stuff in the little box and it gets sent to the mud.  What the mud 
                    sends back will display in the big box.  You can send multiple commands delimited by a 
                    semicolon (i.e. if you type "e;smile" you will go east and then smile).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Macros: </b> Macros are basically shortcuts.  If you macro 'la' to 'look at' and then 
                    enter 'la broom' in the command window, you will send 'look at broom' to the server.  
                    Macros must be at the beginning of the string.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Aliases: </b> Aliases are like macros, except they are replaced anywhere they appear.  
                    They are applied after macros.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Substitutions: </b> Simple text replacements applied to output from the game, useful 
                    for clarity.  Try subbing your name to '<b>Yourname</b>'.  Subbing to <b>GAG</b> will 
                    omit the entire line.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Triggers: </b> Sends a command whenever the game sends output that matches a regex.  
                    If you're not familiar with regex, gird your loins and search for "how to regex" or similar.
                    Triggers are evaluated after substitutions.  '$N' will be replaced by the Nth capture group, 
                    so try something like triggering '(.*) goes (.*)' to 'say $1 just went $2!'
                </li>
